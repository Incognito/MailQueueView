MailQueueView
=============

Because sending an email to test an email template is a silly thing to do 80%
of the time.

## What?

This is meant to be a GUI layer to read email from your mail queue (you have a
mail queue system, right?).

You'll need to write an adaptor layer to connect this GUI to your database (or
whatever you store things into). It shouldn't be too hard to do, just implement
the methods on the interfaces.

## How?

TODO add install instructions
TODO implement interface
